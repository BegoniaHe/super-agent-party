## Introduction

üöÄ Zero Intrusion ¬∑ Minimalist Expansion ¬∑ Empower LLM APIs with Enterprise-Grade Capabilities without modifying a single line of code, seamlessly add advanced features to your LLM interfaces, including knowledge base integration, real-time internet access, permanent memory, code execution tools, MCP, A2A, deep thinking control, in-depth research, visual understanding, image generation, custom tools, and more. Build a plug-and-play LLM enhancement middleware platform. At the same time, you can deploy your agent configuration to social platforms with just one click (official QQ bot is already supported).You can also use the workflows built on other intelligent platform as tools for intelligent agents (comfyui is already supported).

## Why Choose Us?
- ‚úÖ Efficient development: Supports streaming output, does not affect the original API's response speed, and no code changes are required
- ‚úÖ Quick access: Avoids repeated access to multiple service providers for a single function, pre-configured with mainstream LLM manufacturer/intelligent body protocol adapters, compatible with OpenAI/Ollama/MCP/A2A, and experience the next-generation LLM middleware instantly
- ‚úÖ High customization: Supports advanced agent features such as custom knowledge base, real-time internet access, permanent memory, code execution tools, MCP, A2A, deep thinking control, in-depth research, visual capabilities, image generation, and custom tools, allowing you to build a plug-and-play LLM enhancement middleware platform.  
Customized agents can be saved as snapshots for easy reuse in the future. The snapshot agents can be directly called using the OpenAI API.
- ‚úÖ Data security: Supports local knowledge base and local model access, ensuring data is not leaked and enterprise data security is maintained. All files will be cached locally and will not be uploaded anywhere.
- ‚úÖ Team collaboration: Supports team collaboration, multi-person sharing of knowledge base, model services, tools, MCP, A2A, and other resources, improving team collaboration efficiency. Chat records or files and images in the knowledge base are stored locally and can be used as a local file bed or image bed.
- ‚úÖOne-click deployment: Supports one-click deployment to social software, such as QQ, making it convenient for users to use the agent anytime and anywhere.

## Quick Start

### Windows Desktop Installation

  üëâ [Click to download](https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party/releases/download/v0.2.1/Super-Agent-Party-Setup-0.2.1.exe)

‚≠ê Note! Choose to install only for the current user during installation, otherwise, administrator privileges will be required to start.

### MacOS Desktop Installation (beta test)

  üëâ [Click to download](https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party/releases/download/v0.2.1/Super-Agent-Party-0.2.1-Mac.dmg)

‚≠ê Note! After downloading, drag the app file from the dmg file to the `/Applications` directory. Then open the Terminal and execute the following command, entering the root password when prompted, to remove the Quarantine attribute added due to being downloaded from the internet:

  ```shell
  sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Super-Agent-Party.app
  ```

### Linux Desktop Installation

We provide two mainstream Linux installation package formats for your convenience in different scenarios.

#### 1. Install using `.AppImage` (Recommended)

`.AppImage` is a Linux application format that does not require installation and can be used immediately. Suitable for most Linux distributions.

  üëâ [Click to download](https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party/releases/download/v0.2.1/Super-Agent-Party-0.2.1-Linux.AppImage)

#### 2. Install using `.deb` package (Suitable for Ubuntu/Debian systems)

  üëâ [Click to download](https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party/releases/download/v0.2.1/Super-Agent-Party-0.2.1-Linux.deb)

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

- Two commands to install this project:
  ```shell
  docker pull ailm32442/super-agent-party:latest
  docker run -d -p 3456:3456 -v ./super-agent-data:/app/data ailm32442/super-agent-party:latest
  ```

- ‚≠êNote! `./super-agent-data` can be replaced with any local folder, after Docker starts, all data will be cached in this local folder and will not be uploaded anywhere.

- Plug and play: access http://localhost:3456/

### Source Code Deployment

- Windows:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party.git
  cd super-agent-party
  uv sync
  npm install
  start_with_dev.bat
  ```

- Linux or Mac:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/heshengtao/super-agent-party.git
  cd super-agent-party
  uv sync
  npm install
  chmod +x start_with_dev.sh
  ./start_with_dev.sh
  ```

## Usage

- Desktop: Click the desktop icon to use immediately.

- Web or docker: Access http://localhost:3456/ after startup.

- API call: Developer-friendly, perfectly compatible with OpenAI format, can output in real-time, and does not affect the original API's response speed. No need to modify the calling code:

  ```python
  from openai import OpenAI
  client = OpenAI(
    api_key="super-secret-key",
    base_url="http://localhost:3456/v1"
  )
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="super-model",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is Super Agent Party?"}
    ]
  )
  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```

- MCP call: After starting, you can invoke the local MCP service by writing the following content in the configuration file:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "super-agent-party": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp",
      }
    }
  }
  ```
