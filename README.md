## Usage

- Desktop: Click the desktop icon to use immediately.

- Web or docker: Access http://localhost:3456/ after startup.

- API call: Developer-friendly, perfectly compatible with OpenAI format, can output in real-time, and does not affect the original API's response speed. No need to modify the calling code:

  ```python
  from openai import OpenAI
  client = OpenAI(
    api_key="super-secret-key",
    base_url="http://localhost:3456/v1"
  )
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="super-model",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is Super Agent Party?"}
    ]
  )
  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```

- MCP call: After starting, you can invoke the local MCP service by writing the following content in the configuration file:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "super-agent-party": {
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp",
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Features

0. Switch from the sidebar to the call method to see how to invoke Agent Party through OpenAI API, MCP server, docker, and the web interface. The OpenAI interface has added the following switch parameters:
  - enable_thinking: The default is False, whether to enable the thinking mode.
  - enable_deep_research: The default is False, whether to enable the deep research mode.
  - enable_web_search: The default is False, whether to enable web search.
1. Knowledge base, allowing the large model to answer questions based on the information in the knowledge base. And it supports the following functions:
  - If there are multiple knowledge bases, the model will actively query the corresponding knowledge base according to the question requirements.
  - You can choose the timing of retrieval, and you can choose to actively retrieve or passively retrieve the knowledge base.
  - We have supported the rerank model, which can improve the retrieval effect of the knowledge base.
  - Support mixed search function, which allows you to choose the proportion between keyword search and semantic search.
2. Networking function, which allows the large model to actively query information online according to the needs of the question. Currently, it supports:
  - [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) (Completely free, but cannot be accessed in China's online environment)
  - [searxng](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) (can be locally deployed with Docker)
  - [tavily](https://tavily.com/)ÔºàÈúÄË¶ÅÁî≥ËØ∑api keyÔºâ
  - [jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) (can be used for web scraping without an API key)
  - [crawl4ai](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) (can be locally deployed with Docker, and is used for web scraping).
3. [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) service, which allows large models to actively invoke the MCP service according to the needs of the query. Currently, it supports three invocation methods: standard input and output, server-sent events (SSE), streaming HTTP, and websocket.
4. [A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A) service, which allows large models to actively invoke the A2A service according to the needs of the query.
5. Deep thinking allows us to transplant the reasoning ability of the inference model into tools or multimodal models, so that the large model can use the inference model for reasoning analysis before tool invocation. For example: deepseek-V3 can be invoked by tools, but the inference model deepseek-R1 cannot be invoked by tools. In this case, we can transplant the reasoning ability of deepseek-R1 into deepseek-V3, so that deepseek-V3 can use deepseek-R1 for reasoning analysis before tool invocation.
6. Conduct in-depth research, convert users' problems into tasks, gradually analyze and infer, then invoke tools. After outputting the results, we will recheck whether the task is completed. If the task is not completed, we will continue to analyze and infer, then invoke tools until the task is completed.
7. Custom LLM tools can convert LLM interfaces into LLM tools, and any project that adapts to the Ollama format or the OpenAI interface can be used as a tool.
8. Visual caching, which allows you to configure a visual model separately for recognizing image information. The recognition results will be cached to save tokens. Configuring a visual model can enable some models without visual capabilities (for example, most inference models, etc.) to acquire visual capabilities.
9. Storage space management function, which allows you to view the files and pictures uploaded in chat in the storage space, and they are all cached locally, enhancing the software's function of image and file storage.
10. Added memory module, which can be viewed on the tool interface.
- To add new memories, you need to add a word embedding model, and the agent will update the memory vector database in real time. Every time you answer, it will automatically search for relevant memories.
The memory module can be enabled and disabled in the memory configuration, and the number of results can be adjusted to allow the agent to see more or less relevant memories.
11. Implemented widgets: current time, retrieving content from file/image URLs, pseudo reasoning, Pollinations image generation, enhanced rendering of LaTeX formulas, and language tone.
  - Current time: Get the current time.
  - Retrieve the content from the file/image URL: Retrieve the content from the file/image URL.
  - Pseudo-reasoning: Enabling a model that doesn't have reasoning capabilities to acquire them.
  - Pollinations image generation: Call the Pollinations image generation API to generate images. (No API key is needed.)
  - Enhanced latex formula rendering: Control the more stable output of latex formulas in large models.
  - Language tone: Control the more stable output language and tone of the large model.
